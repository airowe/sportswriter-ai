    "title": "Three-Star Edge Rusher Obinna Umeh commits to Duke",
    "body": "Heading in to the second Official Visit weekend of June, the Blue Devils' coaching staff was looking to add to their class of five commits. With double-digit visitors on campus with their families, the coaches zeroed on a the lone Defensive Lineman who was in town - Edge Rusher Obinna Umeh.\n\nBefore leaving campus, the 6'4\", 225 pound Umeh let the coaches know that he would be shutting down his recruitment and pledging his word to play at Duke next season. Umeh joins three other defensive line commits in Ayden Cain, Dane Bathurst, and Chadwicke Cannon to bolster a defensive front that has been one of the most disruptive in all of college football since Harland Bower joined the coaching staff.\n\nUmeh, a Houston native who plays for St. Thomas High School, was scheduled to take official visits to Michigan State next weekend and Stanford the following but he's shutting down his recruitment after being at Duke. Bower led the recruiting charge for the Blue Devils to land Umeh, a high academic football recruit who fits the academic/athletic profile of Duke players perfectly.\n\nThere was a last minute push from Stanford to lure Umeh away from the Blue Devils, where he had verbally committed during his visit. However, the Duke coaches were able to re-solidify his commitment as he announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe Blue Devils' 2026 recruiting class now sits at thirteen members, and is ranked at No. 56 nationally.\n\n© 2005-2025 CBS INTERACTIVE ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

    "title": "2024 Duke Football Position Preview: Quarterbacks",
    "body": "As the 2024 college football season approaches, Duke Football fans have much to look forward to, particularly regarding the quarterback position. With a blend of new talent and experienced players, the Blue Devils' quarterback room features Maalik Murphy, Grayson Loftis, and Henry Belin. Guided by Offensive Coordinator Jonathan Brewer, who brings an uptempo offensive scheme from his time at SMU under Rhett Lashlee and previous stops under Gus Malzahn, this trio has the potential to thrive.\n\nDuke's quarterback situation for the 2024 season is brimming with potential and intrigue. Maalik Murphy's arrival adds a new dynamic, Grayson Loftis provides steady and experienced play, and Henry Belin brings an element of untapped talent. With Offensive Coordinator Jonathan Brewer's fast-paced offensive scheme, these quarterbacks are well-positioned to navigate the challenges of the upcoming season and potentially surprise many in the ACC. Fans should keep a close eye on how this competition unfolds, as the performance of these quarterbacks will be pivotal to the Blue Devils' success.\n\nThe buzzwords that have been used to describe Duke's offensive approach this coming season has been \"fast\", \"uptempo\", and \"aggressive\". That's no surprise considering Brewer's coaching mentors, and if implemented properly should lead to some exciting and high scoring games in Durham. Duke's coaching staff had a lot of holes to fill when they took over a roster that won seventeen combined games the two years prior, but none more glaring than the quarterback position. All Manny Diaz and his staff did was land Maalik Murphy from Texas, after the former Elite 11 participant sat behind Quinn Ewers (and ahead of Arch Manning) on the depth chart for the last two years.\n\nMurphy was considered by 247Sports.com to be the No. 40 player in the transfer portal all offseason, and the sixth-best available quarterback (two spots ahead of former Blue Devil Riley Leonard, now at Notre Dame). Here's what to expect from Duke's quarterback room in 2024, with all eyes on a battle between Murphy and Loftis during Fall Camp.\n\n#12 Grayson Loftis - 6'3\", 205 pounds - Sophomore\n\nThe plan for Loftis was to redshirt his freshman year, learning on the job behind returning starter Riley Leonard and then-second year player Henry Belin. But you know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men... Loftis was thrust into action after both Leonard and Belin suffered season-ending injuries, starting the final five games of the year in impressive fashion considering the circumstances.\n\nThat in-game experience will serve Loftis well in his second year on the college level, and has brought him into a gamely competition with Murphy heading in to Fall Camp. It has to be reassuring for Diaz and Brewer to know that they have two guys in the QB room to have started multiple games, even if it's expected that Murphy will be the starter in Week One against Elon.\n\n#3 Henry Belin - 6'3\", 210 pounds - Redshirt Sophomore\n\nBelin stepped in ready to play against NC State when Leonard first injured himself, showing out impressively as the Blue Devils blew the doors off the Wolfpack 24-3. But when Leonard re-injured himself after giving it a go on the road at Florida State, Belin managed just 35 yards of offense. He didn't return again the rest of the year, as Leonard played one game against Louisville with an injury and Loftis took over the starting job the rest of the year. Belin has been recovering from surgery, and is still working his way back into game shape (mentally and physically) as the season approaches.\n\n#6 Maalik Murphy - 6'5\", 238 pounds - Redshirt Sophomore\n\nMurphy was the prize addition for Manny Diaz out of the transfer portal, choosing the Blue Devils over opportunities from Oregon State, South Carolina, and Baylor, among others. If he were to have committed to Duke out of high school, Murphy would be the highest-ranked signee in program history. Everyone I've spoken with who has seen Murphy in person is amazed at his size, which parlays itself into him having a cannon of an arm. He's not a dual-threat QB by any means, but has the type of arm talent that has not graced the field at Wallace Wade in years.\n\nMaalik Murphy's transfer from Texas brings a surge of excitement to Duke's offense. Known for his strong arm and athleticism, Murphy's high school career was stellar, and he was a highly-touted recruit coming out of Junipero Serra High School in Gardena, California. At Texas, Murphy showed glimpses of his potential but struggled for playing time behind more established quarterbacks. His big arm will add a new dimension to the Blue Devils' playbook, although he might not have the same ability as Loftis or Belin to extend plays with his legs.\n\nAdapting to Jonathan Brewer's uptempo scheme, which emphasizes quick plays and high tempo, Murphy's athleticism and strong arm will be key assets. While there may be an adjustment period as Murphy acclimates to a new system and teammates, his talent and athleticism should make him a game-changer for Duke.\n\nLook for Murphy to win the starting job, and as long as he stays healthy should be QB1 for the duration of the season. Loftis provides a solid safety net should Murphy be forced to the bench, while Belin is expected to spend the majority of his time recovering and acting as the scout team QB.\n\n© 2005-2025 CBS INTERACTIVE ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

    "title": "2024 Duke Football Position Preview: Wide Receivers",
    "body": "Duke Football is loaded at the skill positions in 2024, but especially at the wide receiver spot. Nearly every major contributor is back from last year's highly productive receiving corps, and the program brought in highly sought after transfer WR Javon Harvey. With six of the top seven non-running back pass catchers back for another go at Duke, new Offensive Coordinator Jonathan Brewer will have a wealth of options at his disposal for Texas transfer QB Maalik Murphy.\n\nJordan Moore led the way for Duke's receiving efforts last year in total catches, receiving yards, and touchdowns, and is expected to be a favorite target of Murphy as this offense looks to get the ball into playmakers' hands. Moore will pair once again with Eli Pancol, a sixth year guy who sat out all last year with an injury, with Sahmir Hagans, Jontavis Robertson, and Harvey making up a solid five-man rotation at the top.\n\nIt would not be surprising to see true freshman Chase Tyler get on the field, but there are so many veteran guys in front of him on the depth chart it might be hard to crack except in certain scenarios. Redshirt Freshmen Sean Brown and Spencer Jones will also be pushing the guys ahead of them throughout Fall Camp and into the season, but again it will not be easy to surpass any of the guys entrenched as starters without any unexpected injuries.\n\nIron sharpens iron, and there will be plenty of it to go around this upcoming season.\n\n#1 Jontavis Robertson - 5'11\", 190 pounds - Redshirt Senior\n\nGoing in to his fifth year at Duke, Robertson has made his biggest contributions on special teams but has brought in 39 receptions for 367 yards (9.41) throughout his career. Robertson has been Mr. Reliable in his time in Durham, as he has missed just one career game. In 48 career games (2 starts), Robertson has caught 39 receptions for 367 yards (9.41) with one TD. He's fifth on the depth chart this year, but should see time as Duke rotates guys this season.\n\n#2 Sahmir Hagans - 5'10\", 185 pounds - Redshirt Junior\n\nAs a redshirt sophomore, Hagans saw action in all 13 games (9 starts), registering 30 receptions for 260 yards (8.67). His breakout performance came in the Birmingham Bowl, when he recorded a season-high five receptions for 55 yards against Troy. The shifty Philadelphia, Pa. native will likely play a big role on the offense this season alongside Jordan Moore, Eli Pancol, and Javon Harvey, splitting third receiver snaps with Pancol.\n\n#4 Eli Pancol - 6'3\", 205 pounds - Graduate Student\n\nThe demonstrable sixth year player has as much personality in his game as he has color in his hair, and is one of the most exciting guys to watch on the field for this team. He played just nine games in 2022 as injuries limited his availability, yet racked up 347 yards on 23 catches. He has been a starter the last two years, but the emergence of Hagans will make for a big competition heading in to his fifth season.\n\n#8 Jordan Moore - 6'0\", 195 pounds - Graduate Student\n\nThere seems to be little that Moore is not able to do on a football field, as the athlete competed to the bitter end for the starting quarterback position last year before sliding in to the wide receivers' room and immediately fighting for starting snaps. Moore is on the watch lists for the Biletnikoff Award and Maxwell Award after earning preseason Second Team All-American honors.\n\n#14 Sean Brown - 5'8\", 160 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\nAfter conserving his redshirt last year, Brown will enter in to a crowded WRs room fighting for snaps. He played in two games against Pittsburgh and Troy … recorded two receptions for 19 yards (9.50) … on the field for 27 snaps.\n\n#83 Spencer Jones - 6'4\", 197 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\nJones saw action in one game last year, and enters in to his second year on the college level after preserving his redshirt last season.\n\n#7 Javon Harvey - 5'11\", 180 pounds - Graduate Transfer\n\nWhen Harvey transferred from Old Dominion, he was quickly recruited by a number of programs across the country. After committing to Texas A&M, Duke WRs coach Zohn Burden continued to recruit him and ultimately gained a flip commitment from the Aggies. Harvey has been impressive during Fall Camp, and should battle for starting snaps despite the strength of the receivers' room.\n\n#11 Chase Tyler - 6'2\", 157 pounds - Freshman\n\nTyler chose the Blue Devils over offers from Tennessee, Michigan, and many others, and stuck with his decision despite the coaching change. Although the majority of his classmates enrolled early, the multi-sport athlete wanted to play his senior year of basketball. Despite enrolling this summer, Tyler has made a lot of waves in Fall Camp and should be pushing for snaps right away as a true freshman.\n\n#18 Jayden Moore - 5'8\", 166 pounds - Freshman\n\nThe younger brother of Jordan Moore, Jayden enrolled early in January to get a jump start on his college career. Unfortunately for him, he suffered an injury that will likely keep him out of action this year.\n\nJordan Moore is going to be the guy this year, as he has a real chance to be Duke Football's first 1,000-yard receiver since Jamison Crowder in 2014. He led the team with 835 yards receiving on 62 catches (13.47 yards per catch), finding the endzone for a team-leading eight touchdowns. But Maalik Murphy is going to have plenty of weapons at his disposal through the air.\n\nSahmir Hagans, with 30 games played and 15 starts, Eli Pancol at 44 career games (11 starts), Javon Harvey with 38 career games (23 starts) -- that's a really old wide receivers' room. These guys have been through the ringer and know what it takes to be successful at the college level. Having multiple targets for Maalik Murphy to distribute the ball to, who are experienced route runners and have shown the ability run multiple route trees, is invaluable.\n\nIt remains to be seen just how fast Jonathan Brewer's offense will be at Duke, but the offenses he's worked in and called plays for certainly indicates that there will be many opportunities for the Blue Devils to get the ball in the hands of their playmakers and put pressure on opposing defenses. Keep an eye on Chase Tyler, if he's able to play physically despite his thin stature, as a darkhorse candidate to put up stats beyond the top five guys.\n\nExpectations for starters on opening day are Jordan Moore, Sahmir Hagans, and Javon Harvey, but this room truly goes deep so don't be surprised if Jontavis Robertson, Sean Brown, and Spencer Jones see the field in certain situations.\n\n© 2005-2025 CBS INTERACTIVE ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

    "title": "2024 Duke Football Position Preview: Tight Ends",
    "body": "The Tight End position can be utilized in more ways than maybe any other skill position group on the offensive side of the ball, as they can shift from being primarily blockers to being used as an integral piece of the passing game. While Offensive Coordinator Kevin Johns' system did not target Tight Ends as much as others, new OC Jonathan Brewer comes from a scheme that leans on the position frequently.\n\nThat was music to Nicky Dalmolin's ears, who had all but given up football after this past year, as he rejoined the Duke Football roster after Spring Practice and is an unsung addition to the Blue Devils' offensive attack this Fall. As a fifth year player, Dalmolin will utilize his free Covid year of eligibility and look to build on an impressive career in Durham to catapult himself into professional football.\n\nBrewer has helped coach guys like Will Mallory, Brevin Jordan, and Kylen Granson at the Tight End spot who have parlayed their college success into NFL careers, and he's expected to bring that experience to the Duke offense and coach up Dalmolin and Hasley to similar heights. Here's what to expect from this group heading in to the 2024 season.\n\n#81 Nicky Dalmolin - 6'4\", 241 pounds - Graduate Student\n\nJust when it seems like Nicky Dalmolin is about to be fully healthy for an entire season, another injury has popped up to keep him off the field. The Blue Devils' leading receiver at the tight end spot has missed three games in each of the last two years, and almost didn't return for his fifth and final season. But after watching Duke's offense in Spring Practice, Dalmolin saw an opportunity to be more involved in the passing game than he had been his last two years, and rejoined the program.\n\n#85 Jeremiah Hasley - 6'3\", 239 pounds - Redshirt Sophomore\n\nAfter converting from the linebackers room last year, Hasley made an instant impact on the offensive side of the ball. He saw action in all 13 games last year, starting five games (Florida State, Louisville, North Carolina, NC State and Wake Forest). Hasley recorded just five receptions for 52 yards (10.4) and one TD, highlighting how little Johns' offense utilized the tight end position. Although he took over the starting spot from Dalmolin last year after the latter went down with an injury, Hasly is expected to be the primary backup to Dalmolin heading in to this season.\n\n#15 Jake Taylor - 6'5\", 235 pounds - Redshirt Sophomore\n\nIn six career games, recorded one reception for 14 yards (14.00) and has played 36 career snaps. Taylor has been working with the wide receivers during Fall Camp, but his best opportunity to see the field this season will likely be at Tight End.\n\n#80 Vance Bolyard - 6'5\", 235 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\nIn one career game (against Lafayette last year), played a total of six snaps.\n\n#82 Brett Elliott - 6'3\", 231 pounds - Freshman\n\nSummer enrollee\n\nNicky Dalmolin is going to be target #1 for Maalik Murphy in Duke's passing game this Fall, and should be in position to set career highs in receptions, yards, and touchdowns as part of Offensive Coordinator Jonathan Brewer's scheme.\n\n\"First of all, it was a great honor to what we as coaches do on offense, and the culture that they have here at Duke,\" Brewer told the media earlier in Fall Camp. \"I think Nicky came out in the Spring and watched us practice and saw how much we were throwing the ball around. And especially the tight end is catching the ball a lot. It's not just in the core blocking all the time. And so, I think he got excited that he wouldn't have to go in and be block power counter inside zone all the time, I can actually go out and run routes and be a highly productive person in the offense.\"\n\nBack for his fifth year, and fully recovered from the injuries that slowed him down the past two years, Dalmolin is projected to have one of his best seasons on the college level. This will be his third head coach, and fourth Offensive Coordinator, but there's clearly something in Brewer's scheme that drew him off the couch and back on to the field.\n\n\"If you look at our offense the last four years, we've had guys like RJ Maryland, Brevin Jordan, Will Mallory, Kylen Granson... guys that are big-time NFL players. And so he sees that and sees what we've been doing and I think it got him excited. Having him involved with us the first five days, it is noticeable. Him and Hasley together, those are two dynamic players in our offense.\"\n\nWith Hasley's starting experience from last year and a full offseason to work on his craft, he'll be more than just a backup guy. Don't be surprised to see both he and Dalmolin on the field at the same time, and for him to also put up career numbers as a receiver.\n\n© 2005-2025 CBS INTERACTIVE ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

    "title": "2024 Duke Football Position Preview - Linebackers",
    "body": "While Duke lost its two most experienced linebackers this offseason, they'll add snaps this year after bringing in a couple of grad transfers from the portal. Not to mention their two true freshmen from last year saw playing time for four and five games respectively, and they have two starters back in Nick Morris and Tre Freeman.\n\nThis might be the most solid position group on the Blue Devils' team this year, with so many returnees and new additions. The linebackers room is so deep, it may lend itself to a slight shift in defensive scheme from Diaz' traditional 4-2-5 base. Any good Defensive Coordinator will disguise where pressure is coming from, and although the base package for most defenses on the college level is some form of a nickel package, invariably you'll see a safety come up in the box, a defensive end come off the line of scrimmage, or any number of combinations that we saw from Duke's squad last year when there were sometimes only two defensive linemen when the ball was hiked.\n\nIt's possible we could see Jonathan Patke roll out more of a 4-3 look next year, as there are plenty of linebackers on the roster who could play outside and go after the quarterback or even drop back into coverage. On another note, there will be one linebacker on the field at all times this year who will have a communication device inside their helmet and will act as the QB of the defense. That has traditionally been the MLB in the NFL, but it will be interesting to see who the designated playcaller will be when Duke takes the field next weekend.\n\n#12 Tre Freeman - 6'0\", 230 pounds - Redshirt Junior\n\nAs a Redshirt Sophomore last year, Freeman has recorded 127 tackles, 6.5 TFL, 2.5 sacks, one INT, three PBUs, one forced fumble, and six QB pressures. He enters the 2024 season as a surefire starter at the Linebacker position. Freeman earned preseason All-ACC honors from Athlon Sports and Phil Steele, and will be a cornerstone piece of Jonathan Patke and Manny Diaz' defensive attack.\n\n#30 Carter Wyatt - 6'1\", 240 pounds - Redshirt Sophomore\n\nDid not see game action this past season after recovering from an upper body injury during his freshman year.\n\n#36 Nick Morris - 6'3\", 236 pounds - Redshirt Junior\n\nA fourth year player, Morris started the final five games of last season but played in all thirteen matchups. Throughout his career, he has seen time in 19 career games (5 starts), recorded 74 tackles, 2.5 TFL, 1.0 sack and one fumble recovery.\n\n#17 Kendall Johnson - 6'3\", 223 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\nAlthough he preserved his redshirt as a true freshman, Johnson saw action in four career games, and has compiled seven tackles, 1.5 TFL and 1.0 sack. There's a depth issue at this position if Duke plays nickel base and only has two linebackers on the field together, but don't be surprised to see Johnson on the field.\n\n#34 Luke Mergott - 6'3\", 220 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\nAs a true freshman, Mergott is credited for playing in five career games but has maintained redshirt status somehow heading in to his sophomore year. Mergott provides solid game experience to a deep position group.\n\n#4 Cameron Bergeron - 6'0\", 190 pounds - Senior\n\nHis first career start came against Troy in the Birmingham Bowl, and has seen action in 33 career games, mostly on special teams. Yet another experienced player, Bergeron will see playing time whether on kick/punt returns or in the rotation at linebacker.\n\n#3 Alex Howard - 6'2\", 230 pounds - Graduate Transfer\n\nAfter five years at Youngstown State, Howard transferred to Texas A&M for Spring Practice before changing course and deciding to play his last year on the college level at Duke. He earned Honorable Mention All-MVFC honors in 2023, playing in 40 career games (16 starts), and registered 142 tackles, 15.5 TFL, 5.0 sacks, one INT, four PBU, three QB pressures, two fumble recoveries and one forced fumble.\n\n#11 Derrick Brown - 6'1\", 220 pounds - Freshman\n\nIn a less deep linebackers room, Derrick Brown would likely see playing time as a true freshman. But expect him to redshirt this year to preserve his eligibility.\n\n#31 Montreze Smith - 5'11\", 210 pounds - Freshman\n\nLook for Smith to work on development during his true freshman year as he prepares for next season.\n\n#45 Ozzie Nicholas - 6'2\", 225 pounds - Graduate Transfer\n\nHis four years at Princeton saw Ozzie Nicholas earn FCS All-America honors in 2023 (Pro Football Focus, 1st and Stats Perform, 3rd) and All-Ivy League selections (2023 – 1st and 2022 – 2nd). In 25 ca­reer games (20 starts), has registered 179 tackles, 10.5 TFL, 5.5 sacks, one INT, four PBU, eight QB pressures, one fumble recovery and three caused fumbles. Nicholas is on the watch list for the Reese's Senior Bowl, indicating just how good of a pickup he was in the transfer portal.\n\nTre Freeman and Nick Morris are the most likely players to start at linebacker on opening night, but Ozzie Nicholas and Alex Howard will push that returning duo for snaps in Duke's aggressive defensive scheme. The Blue Devils are going to rotate a number of guys on the defensive side of the ball if the opposition allows them to do so, as linebackers in Manny Diaz' defense are in position to rack up numerous opportunities for making plays.\n\nFreeman led the team with 106 tackles last season, and appears poised to add to that number this season, while Morris finished the season with 61 tackles and should continue to improve on those stats by season's end. Who fills in behind that duo is the biggest question, as Johnson and Mergott look to continue their play that saw them get action as true freshmen.\n\n© 2005-2025 CBS INTERACTIVE ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

    "title": "2024 Duke Football Position Preview - Defensive Line",
    "body": "Duke Football's Defensive Line is undergoing a massive overhaul, not unlike the Offensive Line, as multiple players are off to the NFL, other programs via the transfer portal, and graduation. Not to mention a new Defensive Tackles Coach in Gabe Infante, a new Defensive Coordinator in Jonathan Patke, and a new Head Coach in Manny Diaz.\n\nThose last two names were two of the best defensive coaches in the nation last year at getting in to the opposition's backfield, ranking second and third respectively at tackles for loss. It's a hallmark of Diaz' defenses going back to his days coaching the Miami Hurricanes, disrupting offenses before they can get going.\n\nDiaz didn't coin the term \"HAVOC\" to describe what his defense is looking to do, but he's shown over the years to be incredibly effective at coaching his players to create the kind of plays that are defined by it. Interceptions, Pass Break-Ups, Forced Fumbles, QB Hits, Sacks, and Tackles for Loss and all considered to be parts of the formula that make up Havoc plays.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, we'll be talking about Duke's D-Line, who will be responsible for sacks and forced fumbles, along with tackles for loss, which should be aplenty based on Diaz and Patke's previous stops.\n\n#99 Aaron Hall - 6'4\", 290 pounds - Redshirt Junior\n\nAlthough he was behind three guys on the depth chart this past season, fourth year Defensive Lineman Aaron Hall is ready to make his mark on the interior of the Duke Football defense. He has logged time in 26 career games, picking up 36 tackles, 3.5 TFL, 2.0 sacks, 2.0 PBU, 3.0 QB pressures, and 1.0 forced fumbles along the way. In Week One, Hall will eclipse 500 career snaps, showing that although he hasn't been a name on the national college football radar, he's got plenty of experience under his belt.\n\n#44 David Anderson - 6'4\", 285 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\nPlayed in three career games last year, tallying four tackles. Anderson posted a career-high two tackles against Lafayette and was on the field for 40 career.\n\n#25 Desmond Aladuge - 6'4\", 276 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\nSaw the field once last year (against Lafayette), logging three snaps.\n\n#56 Terry Simmons - 6'2\", 310 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\nAn injury derailed his freshman season after he was impressing during camp, but there are expectations for the second year player to make impact now that he's healthy. Hall and incoming transfer Kendy Charles are expected to be the starters, but don't be surprised if Simmons is close to the top of snaps after those two by the end of the year.\n\n#7 Vincent Anthony - 6'6\", 250 pounds - Junior\n\nAs an immediate impact player his freshman year, Vincent Anthony, Jr. won the team's rookie of the year award after starting 12 of 13 games. He has consistently improved as an edge rusher under the tutelage of DE coach Harland Bower, and heads in to the 2024 season as a veteran anchor of the defensive line. In 24 career games (16 starts), Anthony has compiled 45 tackles, 6.5 TFL, 2.5 sacks, one fumble recovery, six QB pressures and three PBUs.\n\n#97 Wesley Williams - 63\", 245 pounds - Redshirt Sophomore\n\nWon the team's defensive rookie of the year award in 2023, seeing action in all 13 games. Williams has shed a ton of weight to get ready for a switch from Defensive Tackle to Defensive End this year, and earned Preseason All-ACC honors (4th team) from Athlon Sports. He's expected to start opposite Anthony in a defensive scheme that highlights edge rushers.\n\n#40 Ryan Smith - 6'2\", 240 pounds - Graduate Student\n\nThe fifth year player saw action in all 13 games last year, starting once against Virginia, en route to career highs in tackles (24), tackles for loss (3.0), sacks (2.0), interceptions (1.0), and QB pressures (2.0). He'll head in to this season as one of the top backups to Anthony and Williams.\n\n#14 Michael Reese - 6'3\", 255 pounds - Graduate Student\n\nHeading in to his fifth season, Smith has racked up 54 tackles, 4.0 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks, three PBU, and six QB pressures during his play in 40 games. Look for him to be a solid depth piece in the rotation as Patke's defensive scheme rotates linemen heavily.\n\n#50 Kevin O'Connor - 6'4\", 240 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\n#43 Semaj Turner - 6'3\", 250 pounds - Redshirt Freshman\n\n#10 Tyshon Reed - 6'3\", 240 pounds - Freshman\n\nIncoming freshman, is expected to be a contributor on the Defensive Line this year.\n\n#18 Kobe Smith - 6'3\", 215 pounds - Freshman\n\nIncoming freshman, highest rated recruit in 2024 class.\n\n#51 Will Seiler - 6'4\", 285 pounds - Graduate Transfer\n\nIncoming Graduate Transfer from Pennsylvania, has registered 45 tackles, 3.5 TFL, 1.5 sacks, and two PBUs in 30 career games.\n\n#95 Preston Watson - 6'1\", 292 pounds - Freshman\n\nIncoming freshman, enrolled early.\n\n#96 Christian Rorie - 6'6\", 318 pounds - Graduate Transfer\n\nTransferred to Texas State last year, but is returning to Duke for a sixth season along with Defensive Coordinator Jonathan Patke.\n\n#90 Kendy Charles - 6'0\", 280 pounds - Graduate Transfer\n\nExpected to be an instant impact starter on the inside of the line for Duke after a four-year career at Liberty saw him compile 108 tackles, 22.5 TFL, 13.5 sacks, six QB pressures, one PBU, one fumble recovery and one caused fumble. Charles has played in 37 career games, (21 starts), and was named team captain in 2023.\n\nJonathan Patke and Manny Diaz' defenses finished second and third last year in tackles for loss, a key tenet of their scheme that was crafted during years in Miami. Diaz' Penn State group led the nation with 49 sacks, and Patke's Texas State team was 10th nationally with 40. Texas State was first nationally in fumbles forced (19), and Penn State was tied for 16th.\n\nCreating \"HAVOC\" plays is a hallmark of the aggressive defense played by the pair, which should make Duke's defensive linemen salivate heading in to this season. Kendy Charles and Aaron Hall are expected to be the starters on the interior coming out of Fall Camp, while Vincent Anthony and Wesley Williams are expected to be on the field at edge when the team takes the field against Elon.\n\nAn aggressive defensive scheme like Diaz and Patke employ requires a steady rotation of guys, especially the big ones, and that's where things could get shaky. Especially on the interior, Duke has little proven depth on the D-1 level behind Hall and Charles, so Seiler and Rorie will have to step up in a big way until the youngsters are able to be ready to make a full impact.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, this should be one of the most disruptive defenses Duke has employed. The defensive line is going to be a huge part of that, so don't be surprised to see some of these guys put up career numbers in Diaz and Patke's defensive end friendly schem.\n\n© 2005-2025 CBS INTERACTIVE ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
